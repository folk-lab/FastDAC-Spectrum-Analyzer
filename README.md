# FastDAC-Spectrum-Analyzer

This program allows a user to analyze the power spectral density of a FastDAC's ADC channels.  The code is written in Python and uses a Dash (by Plotly) based interface with built in controls over various input parameters.

## Instructions

1. Download and run FastDAC_Spectrum_Analyzer.py

If the script is run on the same computer on which you plan to use the interface:

2. Open 127.0.0.1 in web browser.

If you plan to use a different device than the one on which the script is run:

2. Ensure that the computer and the device are connected to the same network (ex: Ampel 111 network).
3. Open 10.17.173.72 in web browser.

Note:  You cannot use the interface on more than one device at a time.
