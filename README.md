# FastDAC Spectrum Analyzer

This program allows a user to analyze the power spectral density of a FastDAC's ADC channels.  The code is written in Python and uses a Dash (by Plotly) based interface with built in controls over various input parameters.

## Instructions

1. Download and run FastDAC_Spectrum_Analyzer.py
2. The output will let you know that Dash is running and where to access it (ex: http://10.17.173.64:8050/).
3. To kill the program, type CTRL+C in terminal.

If you plan on accessing the interface on a different device, both the computer and the device must be connected to the same network (ex: Ampel 111 network).  You cannot use the interface on more than one device at a time.
